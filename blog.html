        <h4>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>var: Function-scoped, hoisted, and can be re-declared. Can become a global variable if declared outside functions.</li>
            <li>let: Block-scoped, hoisted (but not initialized), and cannot be re-declared within the same scope.</li>
            <li>const: Block-scoped, hoisted (but not initialized), and variables cannot be reassigned, though their properties (for objects) or elements (for arrays) can be modified.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h4>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>null: Typically used when you want to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or an empty state. It is often set intentionally by the programmer.</li>
            <li>undefined: Represents an uninitialized variable or a missing property in an object. It is usually generated by the JavaScript engine and not typically set by the programmer.</li>
        </ul>
        In summary, use null to represent an intentional absence of a value, and undefined to represent a variable or property that hasn't been assigned a value.

        <h4>What do you mean by REST API?</h4>
        <p>
            A REST API is a standardized way of building web services that use HTTP methods to interact with resources (like data or services) identified by unique URLs. It promotes statelessness, a uniform interface, and separation of client and server concerns for scalable and predictable communication.
